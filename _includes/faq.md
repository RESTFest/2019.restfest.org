## FAQ

### Why is there no agenda or CFP?

We call this "Everybody talks everybody listens"™️.
Each participant is given a slot to present the subject of their choosing. 
Depending on the attendance we'll have speaking slots between 5 and 30 minutes long.
   
### Should I hurry?

That depends... But given the active participation format of REST Fest, availability
is limited. We prefer a smaller crowd and encourage active knowledge sharing.
   
### Do I have to talk about (RESTful) APIs?

Not necessarily. Participants can talk about anything API, even GraphQL or SOAP ;). 
In fact, you can present anything you find exciting:
the biggest challenge they're facing, a cool tool they've used or built, or lessons 
learned from working on a new team - or none of the above. Sometimes a participant simply 
poses a question to the entire group, and lively conversation ensues. Surely, API-related
subjects are preferred but there have been exceptions indeed.
