## FAQ

### Why is there no agenda?

We call this "Everybody talks everybody listens"™️.
Each participant is given a slot to present the subject of their choosing. 
Depending on the attendance and session the slot may be between 5 and 30 minutes long.
   
### Should I hurry?

That depends... But given the active participation format of REST Fest, availability
is limited. We prefer a smaller crowd and encourage active knowledge sharing.
   
### Do I have to talk about RESTful APIs?

Certainly not. It's perfectly fine to present REST-ish, REST-like and even GraphQL ;). 
In fact, you can even talk about something else if you think it will be interesting to 
other participants (see the question below). 

### Do I have to present an API?

Not necessarily. You can talk about what you are passionate about. Surely, API-related
subjects are preferred but there have been exceptions.
