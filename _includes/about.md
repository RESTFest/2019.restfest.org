## FAQ

1. Why is there no agenda?

   We call this "Everybody talks everybody listens"™️.
   Each participant is given a slot to present the subject of their choosing. 
   Depending on the attendance and session the slot may be between 5 and 30 minutes long.
   
1. Should I hurry?

   That depends... But given the active participation format of REST Fest, availability
   is limited. We prefer a smaller crowd and encourage active knowledge sharing.
   
1. Do I have to talk about RESTful APIs?

   Certainly not. It's perfectly fine to present REST-ish, REST-like and even GraphQL ;). 
   In fact, you can even talk about something else if you think it will be interesting to 
   other participants (see the question below). 

1. Do I have to present an API?

   Not necessarily. You can talk about what you are passionate about. Surely, API-related
   subjects are preferred but there have been exceptions.

## It's a Community Event

REST Fest is a community event focused on the REST network architectural style and RESTful 
implementations of the style. Based on the OpenSpaces model, REST Fest puts developers 
front-and-center with a handful of selected speakers, "open mic" style Lightning Talks where anyone 
can present about anything, and access to a "Hack Space" where people can get together and work 
on whatever interests them.

## It's all about Hands-On

REST Fest will encourage developers who have direct experience building RESTful applications 
for the World Wide Web to share their successes and their frustrations in an informal atmosphere. 
Talks that emphasise practical solutions will be favored over theoretical presentations. Showing 
your code is encouraged! The event is platform and technology agnostic with a leaning toward Open 
Source and OSS-friendly environments.

## Call for Presenters

All attendees are encouraged to submit a title, short abstract (250 words or less) and an 
indication of the "level" of the talk (beginner, intermediate, advanced). "How To..." talks are 
encouraged as well as "How Do I?" talks. A small number of talks (about five) will be chosen as 
a "Featured Talk" with a format of 30 minutes plus questions. All talks are automatically accepted 
for the "Lightning Talk" section (Five Slides in Five Minutes). If you want your talk to be 
considered only for one category (Lightning or Selected), indicate that on your proposal. We're 
going to be collecting speaker info on our wiki on [GitHub][wiki].

## Hacking Is Encouraged

REST Fest includes a full Hack Day where attendees can get together and work on any project they 
like. The Hack Rooms will be open throughout the event with power and wireless access provided. 
Attendees are also encouraged to propose talks that result in Hack Room participation including 
frameworks and library authors who are looking for help coding open source libraries.
