# Workshop Wednesday! - September 26<sup>th</sup>

What are Web APIs and how do you design and build them? And what do all these acronyms mean: REST, CRUD, Hypermedia, GraphQL, AOI, Swagger, RAML, Blueprint, OAuth? Join the REST Fest team for a wide-ranging and in-depth workshop that touches on the basics of Web APIs, what makes them work, and how you can navigate the alphabet soup of standards and practices that make up this essential part of the World Wide Web.

**Sessions led by:**
 * Shelby Swtizer

### **LUNCH** (Noon to 1PM)

### **AFTERNOON** (1PM-4PM)
  - Starting with an API definition, we will identify and discuss common REST API design practices and patterns. Topics covered:
    - API definition languages such as Open API Spec (Swagger), RAML, API Blueprint, ALPS, etc
    - Resources & Representation
    - Links
    - Request/Response Loop
  - Next, we will build a client against the API definition. This will be hands-on, but will also include a discussion at the end on what we learned and feedback we would give the API designer. Topics covered:
    - URLs, Methods, and Actions
    - Formats and Representations
    - Following Links
    - Usability
  - Finally, we will update the API spec based on changes we identified that we wanted to make in the previous section, and then build a server to that spec. This will be followed up by a discussion on the pros and cons of the changes made server-side, and how participants would take this further. Topics covered:
    - Versioning
    - Security
    - Testing
